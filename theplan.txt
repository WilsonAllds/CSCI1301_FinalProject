Criteria to be met:
    function to display all info
        we can do this easily by displaying the entire aray with a for loop
    
    function to search and display all info 
        this is a more complex one. the idea that I have is that we assign each student to 
        a row in the array. if student C wanted to search by their
        ID, which would be column 0, we could search for array[2][0]. we would just have to 
        write a function that makes student 1 = a, 2 = b... noting that student 1 would be
        on row 0 due to how arrays start counting at 0. 

    display all course information
        for loop

    export all student info to a file
        for loop and java.io* export methods. i dont think anyone here has done it before tho

    read and process student schedule 

    to be finished
